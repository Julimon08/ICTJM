    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>Reading: I love to read; I spend most of my time (almost the 90% of the
time) reading. I love to read a really good book with a cup of coffee and
when is raining (I know is weird). I like the romance books (I think is
beautifully written), fantasy books (my favorite books are fantasy) and the
police/murder mystery books (I love the adrenaline they make me feel).
My favorite book is ”City of fallen angels” by Cassandra Clare is of the
saga of shadowhunters and I simply love it.
- Draw: I love art in general (like painting with oleos) but I feel that my
favorite will always be Drawing, I just love the feeling of opening a blank
page and let your imagination fly. I fell like it is my secure place is like
when I what to do or say something, but know I can’t, I draw the thing of a
representation of my feelings for I can’t do it.</p>

(specifically Oxford or Yale university, they are just amazing!) somewhere
that is not Colombia. I want to study business and when I finish my career, I
will do my own business (realtor) and live in US or in UK.</p>

<h1>Recomendations</h1>
<p>I am a person that when people ask to recommend something I will always
recommend books; I will recommend you 3 of my favorite books, I really think
they are worthy reading and a person that like the drama and the police
books will enjoy a lot. The books that I will recommend are:
- El Jardín de las mariposas: it is a thriller full of drama and a lot of real live
scenarios (things that actually happen nowadays) and is about a girl that
is telling the story of how a person called “el Jardinero” kidnapped her and
other girls. It is a very good book and I promise it is worthy to read it.
- ALL the saga of Shadow Hunters: This is my favorite book saga (it is just
perfect) the book is developed in a way that is very interesting and the
“world” of this book is very organized. There are a lot of sagas in this saga
but the principal one is about 18-year-old Clary Fray, who finds out on her
birthday that she is not who she thinks, and her mom gets kidnapped by a
guy named Valentine. She discovers that she comes from a long line of
Shadowhunters (human-angel hybrids who hunt down demons).
- La chica de la nieve: It is a very interesting book full of mystery and
drama. It is about a family in 1998 in a Christmas show and when the Dad
and the little girl go to take a balloons the girl (3 years old) gets lost.
5 years after the girl was declared missing the parents receive a video of
the girl (now 8 years old) playing in a unknown room.</p>
